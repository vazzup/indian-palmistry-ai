# Success Metrics & KPIs - Analysis Follow-up Questions

## Executive Summary

This document defines comprehensive success metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the Analysis Follow-up Questions feature. These metrics will guide development decisions, measure feature success, and identify areas for optimization post-launch.

## Metrics Framework

### Metric Categories
1. **Engagement Metrics**: How users interact with the follow-up feature
2. **Quality Metrics**: Effectiveness and satisfaction of the feature
3. **Technical Metrics**: Performance and reliability measures  
4. **Business Metrics**: Revenue and retention impact
5. **Cost Efficiency Metrics**: Resource utilization and ROI

### Measurement Periods
- **Real-time**: Immediate feedback (response times, error rates)
- **Daily**: Short-term trends and immediate issues
- **Weekly**: User behavior patterns and feature adoption
- **Monthly**: Business impact and strategic metrics
- **Quarterly**: Long-term trends and ROI analysis

## Primary Success Metrics

### 1. Feature Adoption Rate

**Measurement**: `(Analyses with ≥1 follow-up question) / (Total completed analyses) × 100`

**Tracking Implementation**:
```sql
-- Daily adoption rate calculation
SELECT 
    DATE(a.created_at) as date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) as total_analyses,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
        WHEN c.is_analysis_followup = true 
        AND c.questions_count > 0 
        THEN a.id 
    END) as analyses_with_followup,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
            WHEN c.is_analysis_followup = true 
            AND c.questions_count > 0 
            THEN a.id 
        END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT a.id), 
        2
    ) as adoption_rate_percent
FROM analyses a
LEFT JOIN conversations c ON a.id = c.analysis_id
WHERE a.status = 'completed'
    AND a.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(a.created_at)
