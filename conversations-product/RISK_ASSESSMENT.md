### Automated Response Procedures
```python
class RiskResponseAutomation:
    async def handle_high_risk_event(self, risk_type: str, severity: str):
        if risk_type == "security" and severity == "critical":
            await self.emergency_shutdown()
            await self.notify_security_team()
        elif risk_type == "cost" and severity == "high":
            await self.enable_cost_controls()
            await self.notify_finance_team()
        elif risk_type == "performance" and severity == "high":
            await self.scale_resources()
            await self.notify_devops_team()
```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive risk assessment identifies the primary threats to the Analysis Follow-up Questions feature and provides detailed mitigation strategies. Regular review and updates of these risk assessments will ensure continued security, performance, and user satisfaction as the feature evolves.

The risk monitoring framework enables proactive identification and response to issues before they impact users, while the mitigation strategies provide clear guidelines for handling various scenarios that may arise during development and operation.

Key success factors include:
1. **Proactive Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of key risk indicators
2. **Layered Security**: Multiple security controls to prevent attacks
3. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient resource usage and scaling
4. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on user experience and satisfaction
5. **Cost Control**: Monitoring and optimization of operational expenses

Regular risk reviews should be conducted monthly during development and quarterly post-launch to ensure the risk landscape remains current and mitigation strategies remain effective.
