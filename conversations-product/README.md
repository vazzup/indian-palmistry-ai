## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Why limit to 5 questions per analysis?
A: The 5-question limit balances user engagement with cost control and quality assurance. It encourages thoughtful questions while preventing system abuse and maintaining response quality.

### Q: How do we ensure AI responses stay focused on palmistry?
A: Multi-layer security including input validation, system prompt engineering, content filtering, and behavioral monitoring prevents off-topic responses and prompt injection attacks.

### Q: What happens if OpenAI API is unavailable?
A: We implement circuit breaker patterns, fallback responses, and graceful degradation to maintain functionality during service outages.

### Q: How do we measure success?
A: Comprehensive metrics track adoption (40% target), engagement (3.2 questions/user), quality (4.5/5 rating), performance (<2s response), and business impact (3x retention improvement).

### Q: What's the mobile experience like?
A: Mobile-first design with responsive interfaces, touch-optimized inputs, and streamlined flows ensure excellent experience across all devices.
