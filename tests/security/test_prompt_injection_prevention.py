"""
Comprehensive security tests for prompt injection prevention.

This module provides extensive testing of security measures implemented in the
Analysis Follow-up Service to prevent prompt injection attacks, content manipulation,
and other security vulnerabilities in AI interactions.

**Security Test Categories:**
- Prompt injection detection and prevention
- Context manipulation attempts
- Role-playing and persona switching attacks
- Instruction override attempts
- Content filtering bypass attempts
- Forbidden topic detection
- Input sanitization validation

**Testing Strategy:**
- Real-world prompt injection examples
- Adversarial prompting techniques
- Edge case testing with borderline content
- Unicode and encoding-based attacks
- Chain-of-thought manipulation attempts
- Social engineering vectors

**Security Coverage:**
- All validation patterns in _validate_question method
- Security filter effectiveness
- Content classification accuracy
- Response to sophisticated attack vectors
- Boundary testing for allowed vs forbidden content
