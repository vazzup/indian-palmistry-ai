### Operational Risks
- **Deployment failures**: Automated testing, rollback procedures
- **Monitoring gaps**: Comprehensive monitoring, alert testing
- **Documentation issues**: Regular updates, review procedures
- **Maintenance complexity**: Automation, clear procedures

## Maintenance Procedures

### Daily Operations
- Monitor system health and performance
- Review error logs and alerts
- Check backup status
- Monitor resource usage

### Weekly Operations
- Review performance metrics
- Update dependencies
- Test backup restoration
- Review security logs

### Monthly Operations
- Security audit and updates
- Performance optimization review
- Capacity planning

## Definition of Done

A production feature is considered complete when:
1. ✅ Code is written and follows production standards
2. ✅ Tests are written and passing
3. ✅ Documentation is updated
4. ✅ Code review is completed
5. ✅ Feature is tested in staging
6. ✅ Performance meets production requirements
7. ✅ Security considerations addressed
8. ✅ Monitoring and alerting configured
9. ✅ Backup procedures tested
10. ✅ Deployment procedures documented
11. ✅ Rollback procedures tested
12. ✅ Production deployment successful
13. ✅ Post-deployment monitoring confirms success
